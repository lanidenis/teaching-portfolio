<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison to the Curriculum Vitae,   the teaching   portfolio   offers versatility and detailed scholarly activity,   thus   allowing   professionals to track different stages of their careers and reflect upon it.   Employers and chairpersons are able to have comprehensive representation of an individual&rsquo;s  professional activities.  The teaching portfolio (TP) will provide documentation of expertise, research progress, teaching experience and educational accomplishments.   </p>
<!--
<h2>Current challenges we face today and how the Teaching Portfolio can help:</h2>
<div class="answer">
<ul>
<li>Increased undergraduate involvement in faculty research.� How would you integrate your research into your courses and enhance student participation in your work? How would you demonstrate interactions and evaluations for different levels of trainees- medical students, respiratory therapist, nurses, high school students?</li>
<li>Increased usage of technology in the classroom and workplace.� How would you use wikis, and/or web-based resources to have a substantial impact on a course that you teach?  How would you demonstrate those interactions?</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary curriculums: Self documentation of descriptive scholarly activity with emphasis on regional, national and international audiences.� How could you archive this if your department does not provide a record of such educational interactions?</li></ul><br>
<br>
<p>
Use your TP to provide not only continuing documentation of professional and scholarly activities, but also to improve your skills, hone your ideas, and develop new tracts and techniques. Instead of updating your CV when appropriate, the TP allows for professional development in all areas of practice: both private and academic. </p></div>
